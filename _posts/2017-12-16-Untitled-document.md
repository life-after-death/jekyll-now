"Hi" as you probably already know this blog is dedicated to addressing the world as it really is. “A bag of shit!” If ur like me you will hate the world for what it is but still enjoy some of the only up sides it has e.g sex, money, alcohol and sleep. If u are observant you will notice that happiness was not on there, that is what this first blog is about.

	Just take a moment to ask yourself what you believe happiness is. Some people say it should be how we live are lives, some other people say  it describes humanity. "I say it's a bloody illusion! You may be asking yourself how i came to this conclusion… Well If you really think about it the natural mood is sadness. Therefore happiness only occurs when something that benefits us and usually us alone. Sometimes we are evan a bit selfish when it comes to happiness.Sometimes if kids get the wrong present at  christmas they might cry but if you immagin starving children in these scorching countries who do you believe deserves that gift more

	

	I would like to end on a happier note (as it is my first blog) by saying happiness can also occur when we want it to even though it is the most abstract 4d thin i know of.

Life after death
